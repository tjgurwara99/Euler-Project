## Let's complete every single Project Euler Question!

### Try to answer as many problems as you can and make sure every problem has only 1 folder for its answers
### Faster, shorter and cleaner code gets bonus points in the leaderboard we're currently making


You can submit multiple answers to a single problem. If an answer uses more than one file it should be all be in a folder.

Make sure you label your answers as the following: [Name][Attempt Number].[]
for example HHassan1.py make sure to use the same name for all of your answers for the leaderboard
