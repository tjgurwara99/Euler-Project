# Euler-Project
I will be Posting my solutions for the ProjectEuler.net website.
I prefer to use C++ and also like to make the whole programs from scratch so, I will try and only use the standard libraries.

Currently I am in the process of making a library for the functions used for the problems in the Project Euler website, which I will soon be sharing with everyone. Until then I will be posting small programs for the specific problems, however the programs would have a lot of repeated code(which goes against the idea of not repeating a code) that I have already used in previous problems. This problem would be solved after I make the library, as stated earlier I am in the process of making it and this would boost the time it takes for the problems to be completed.
